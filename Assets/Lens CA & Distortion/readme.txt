How to Apply:

- Choose from the top menu "Component > Image Effects > Lens CA And Distortion".
- The Image Effect will be applied to your camera.

How to Use:

For Chromatic Aberration:
Adjust the first three sliders to your liking.
To achieve the Red/Blue Chromatic Aberration in the Demo Scene effect set the following values:
	"Red Cyan" 	=  0.0
	"Green Magenta"	= -2.0
	"Blue Yellow" 	= -4.0
These values make the image aberrate outwards.
Adjust to your liking/requirement.

For Barrel Distortion:
Adjust the "Barrel Distortion" slider to the desired amount and adjust the "Zoom" slider to scale the image back to the desired postion.
"Trim Extents" makes the outside portions of the image black when using the CA_border.png in the Trim Texture slot, useful to visualize screen edges using Barrel Distortion.
